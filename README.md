# Cpu-Gpu-Meter

Arduino and Lcd Display, allows you to see real-time performance of your PC. Works with Windows.
Basically, it's monitoring temperature, usage percentage and working frequency informations of Cpu and Gpu, to the LCD display.

It is very useful to follow your PC's status, especially when you're developing a program or just gaming.

First, upload the code to Arduino. There are two different codes in this repo, one of them for normal lcd connection, the other one for I2C connection (as i mentioned).

Then, you should use the "Cpu-Gpu Monitor.exe" to activate the system. It is a program that sends PC's hardware datas to the our Arduino. It should work in background, so do not close.

You can find the schematics and detailed Fritzing file in here.
